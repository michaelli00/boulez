# Mathematics of Pierre Boulez

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Pierre Boulez used mathematics to build upon serialism and develop total serialism. As a convenient way of showcasing Boulez's mathematical ideas, I developed web tools to demonstrate how these ideas were used. Boulez himself mentioned in an interview that

> "Had computers existed at that time I would have put the data through them and made the piece that way. But I did it by hand. I was myself a small and very primitive computer. It was a demonstration through the absurd." 

It's clear that Boulez's mathematical techniques can be modeled from a software development point of view. In this project, I take this idea to heart.
